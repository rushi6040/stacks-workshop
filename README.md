## 1. Project Title  
Attendance Reward dApp

## 2. Project Description  
This Clarity smart contract enables on‑chain attendance tracking and rewards issuance.  
Organizers can mark attendance and mint NFT badges (e.g., soulbound tokens) for participants, ensuring transparency, immutability, and verifiable rewards.

*Functions Implemented:*  
- *mark-attendance(student, event-id)* → Records a participant’s attendance for the specified event.  
- *get-attendance(student, event-id)* → Retrieves attendance status for the participant.  
- *mint-badge(student, event-id)* → Mints an NFT badge for the participant upon confirmed attendance (non-transferable if desired).

## 3. Project Vision  
To build a decentralized, tamper-proof attendance system using Clarity on the Stacks blockchain—starting with individual events and extendable to institutions, conferences, online classes, or community meetups, with verifiable badge issuance as proof of participation.

## 4. Future Scope  
- Add admin-only or organizer-only controls for marking attendance and minting badges.  
- Implement automatic badge issuance after attendance confirmation.  
- Create leaderboard or analytics to highlight most active participants.  
- Introduce badge tiers (e.g., bronze/silver/gold) based on attendance frequency or milestones.  
- Integrate with a frontend dApp for real-time attendance marking, badge viewing, and wallet interaction.  
- Expand interoperability—e.g., display badges on external platforms or support cross-chain functionality.
